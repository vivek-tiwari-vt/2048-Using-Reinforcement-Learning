<img alt="2048 Game" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/2048_logo.svg/220px-2048_logo.svg.png">
Executive Summary
We evaluated a beam search agent on the 2048 game across 100 games with a beam width of 20 and search depth of 30. The agent successfully reached the 4096 tile in 1 game, demonstrating the effectiveness of our implementation.

Metric	Value
Highest Tile Achieved	4096
Best Score	51,372
Average Score	18,945.6
Average Highest Tile	1,315.8
Success Rate (2048+ tiles)	35%
Performance Highlights
Tile Distribution

Interpretation: The histogram shows that the agent most commonly reached the 1024 tile (49% of games), followed by the 2048 tile (34%). It achieved the impressive 4096 tile in 1% of games, demonstrating that our beam search implementation is capable of solving complex game states.

Score Analysis
Score Distribution

Interpretation: The score distribution reveals multiple peaks, corresponding to different maximum tile achievements. The largest concentration of scores is around 15,000-16,000 (correlating with 1024 tiles), with a secondary peak around 27,000-35,000 (correlating with 2048 tiles). The outlier at 51,372 represents our best game where the agent reached the 4096 tile.

Performance Trends
Performance Over Time

Interpretation: The performance charts show relatively consistent results across the 100 games, with no significant improvement or degradation over time. This stability indicates that the beam search algorithm's performance is primarily determined by its parameters and the random tile placements in each game rather than any learning process.

Best Game Analysis
Best Board

Interpretation: In our best game (Game 38), the agent achieved a 4096 tile with a score of 51,372 using 2,486 moves. The board structure shows good organization with larger values concentrated in one corner â€“ a key strategy in 2048.

Tile Achievement Rates
Tile Value	Games Achieved	Percentage
256	2	2.0%
512	14	14.0%
1024	49	49.0%
2048	34	34.0%
4096	1	1.0%
Move Analysis
Several games reached the move limit (5000 moves), indicating potential stalling behavior where the agent couldn't make progress but could continue making valid moves. This suggests room for improvement in end-game strategy.

Conclusions
Strong Performance: The beam search agent achieved the 2048 tile in 35% of games and successfully reached the 4096 tile, demonstrating effective search capabilities.

Beam Search Effectiveness: The specific configuration (beam width=20, search depth=30) balances exploration and computation time well for this problem.

Move Efficiency: The agent required an average of ~1000-1500 moves to reach the 2048 tile, showing relatively efficient gameplay.

Areas for Improvement:

Reducing the 4% of games that stall at the move limit
Increasing the percentage of games reaching 2048+ tiles
Further optimizing evaluation functions for higher success rates at 4096
Next Steps
Experiment with increased beam width for potentially higher 4096 success rates
Implement a hybrid approach combining beam search with learning-based evaluation
Add pattern-based endgame strategies for better handling of critical board states
